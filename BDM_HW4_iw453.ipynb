    "# Homework 4 - MapReduce\n",
    "\n",
    "### DUE: 03/02/2017 before class at 10:30am\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework, we are practicing the MapReduce programming paradigm. \n",
    "\n",
    "You are required to turn in this notebook as BDM\\_HW4\\_**NetId**.ipynb. You will be asked to complete each task using the accompanied *mapreduce* package (as **mapreduce.py**) using one or more MapReduce \"jobs\". For each such job (with mr.run()), you are expected to supply a mapper and a reducer as needed. Below are sample usage of the package:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    # Run on input1 using your mapper1 and reducer1 function\n",
    "    output = list(mr.run(input1, mapper1, reducer1))\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Run on input2 using only your mapper2, no reduce phase\n",
    "    output = list(mr.run(input2, mapper2))\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Run on input3 using 2 nested MapReduce jobs\n",
    "    output = list(mr.run(mr.run(input3, mapper3, reducer3), mapper4, reducer4))\n",
    "```\n",
    "    \n",
    "Please note that the output the mr.run() is always a **generator**. You have to cast it to a list if you'd like to view, index or print it out.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** if you are using Python3 (though I still encourage you to use Python2 for this class), please download the file *mapreduce.py* from NYU Classes again."

    "## Task (10 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "There is only one task in this homework. You are asked to implement the Social Triangle example discussed in class. In particular, given the email dataset, please list all \"reciprocal\" relationships in the company. Recall that:\n",
    "\n",
    "If A emails B and B emails A, then A and B is *reciprocal*.\n",
    "\n",
    "If A emails B but B doesnâ€™t email A, then A and B is *directed*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset:** We will use a subset of the open [Enron Email Dataset](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./enron/ \"Enron Email Dataset\"), which contains approximately 10,000 simplified email headers from the Enron Corporation. You can download this dataset from NYU Classes as **enron_mails_small.csv**. The file contains 3 columns *Date*, *From*, and *To*. Their description is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "|Column name|Description|\n",
    "|--|--|\n",
    "|Date |The date and time of the email, in the format YYYY-MM-DD hh-mm-ss, <br />e.g. \"1998-10-30 07:43:00\" |\n",
    "|From |The sender email address, <br />e.g. \"mark.taylor@enron.com\" |\n",
    "|To | A list of recipients' email addresses separated by semicolons ';', <br />e.g. \"jennifer.fraser@enron.com;jeffrey.hodge@enron.com\" |\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, we only care about users employed by Enron, or only relationships having email addresses that end with *'@enron.com'*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The expected output is also provided below. For each reciprocal relationship, please output a tuple consisting of two strings. The first one is always **'reciprocal'**. And the second one is a string showing the name of the two person in the following format: **'Jane Doe : John Doe'**. The names should be presented in the lexical order, i.e. there will not be a 'John Doe : Jane Doe' since 'Jane' is ordered before 'John.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though the dataset only contains email addresses, not actual names, we're assuming that the email aliases were created based on their name. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "|Email Address|Converted Name|\n",
    "|--|--|\n",
    "|mark.taylor@enron.com|Mark Taylor|\n",
    "|alan.aronowitz@enron.com|Alan Aronowitz|\n",
    "|marc.r.cutler@enron.com|Marc R Cutler|\n",
    "|hugh@enron.com|Hugh|\n",
    "\n",
    "Please fill the code block with a series of MapReduce jobs using your own mapper and reducer functions. Be sure to include the naming convention logic into one of your mappers and/or reducers."
